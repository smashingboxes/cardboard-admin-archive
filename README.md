## Requirements
* An authentication solution. For example, [here is what you need to do](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise#getting-started) to get `Devise` installed.
* `imagemagick` (on mac do `brew install imagemagick`)
* `Rails 4` and `Ruby 2.0`

## Installation
Add the gem to the `Gemfile`

```ruby
gem "cardboard_cms", github: "smashingboxes/cardboard"
```

And run `bundle install`. 

Run the generator to install cardboard and it's migrations:
```sh
rails g cardboard:install
rake db:migrate
```

Edit your `config/cardboard.yml` file then run

```sh
rake cardboard:seed
```


## Usage
### Get a page
Add a file in your `app/views/pages` with filename matching the identifier of the page. Inside this file you can access the page with:
```ruby
current_page
```
### Fetch a page part
```ruby
current_page.get('slideshow')
```

### Fetch a repeatable page part
Repeatable parts returns an active record collection. This means that regular Rails methods such as `where`, `limit`, `first`, `each`, etc can be used on page parts
```slim
- current_page.get('slideshow').each do |slide| 
  p= image_tag slide.attr('image1').thumb('600x300').url, alt: slide.attr('description') if slide.attr('image1')
```
### Fetch a single field
If this part is **not repeatable** you can use both
```ruby
current_page.get('intro').attr('text1')
# Or
current_page.get('intro.text1')
```
### Image Fields methods
Images returned by `image` type fields are [Dragonfly](http://markevans.github.io/dragonfly/) objects. As such, it's possible to edit them directly from the view.

```ruby
if image = current_page.get('intro.image1')
  image.url                 # URL of the modified image
  image.thumb('40x30#').url  # resize, crop if necessary to maintain aspect ratio (centre gravity)
  image.process(:greyscale).thumb('40x30#').url
end # Hint: remember to check if image is not nil before calling methods on it
```
More options and methods are available at [Dragonfly's Documentation](http://markevans.github.io/dragonfly/file.ImageMagick.html)

### File field methods
Similarly to images, files are also Dragonfly objects. This allows such methods as:

```ruby
file.format              # => :pdf
file.name                # => "some.pdf"
number_to_human_size(file.size) # => "486 KB"
```


## Create Pages
To add pages to cardboard edit `config/cardboard.yml`. See an sample `cardboard.yml` in [https://github.com/smashingboxes/cardboard/blob/master/test/dummy/config/cardboard.yml](https://github.com/smashingboxes/cardboard/blob/master/test/dummy/config/cardboard.yml)

```yml
pages:
  home_page:
    title: Default page title
    parts:
      slideshow:
        repeatable: true
        fields:
          image1:
            type: image
            required: true
            default: app/assets/images/CrashTest.jpg
            position: 0
```

pages, parts and fields take identifiers (home_page, slideshow and image1) used to reference the data form the views. Choose these names carefully!

#### Pages
Each page section starts with the name of it's unique identifier. This name is used to reference the page in the code an thus should not change throughout the life of the project.

Key | Type | Default | Definition
---|--- | ---|---
[parts](#parts) | hash | nil |a list of page parts
title | string | identifier | name of the page as shown in the nav bar
position | integer | auto-increment | position of the page on the nav bar (the lowest position is the home page!)
parent_id | string | nil | identifier of the parent page (used for nested pages)


#### Parts
Each part sub-section starts with the name of it's unique identifier. This name is used to reference the part in the code an thus should not change throughout the life of the project.

Key | Type | Default | Definition
---|--- | ---|---
[fields](#fields) | hash | nil | list of fields that make this part's form
position | integer | auto-increment | position of the part on the admin page
repeatable | boolean | false | can the client add multiple of these parts (example a slide in a slideshow) 


####fields
Each field sub-section starts with the name of it's unique identifier. This name is used to reference the field in the code an thus should not change throughout the life of the project.

Key | Type | Default | Definition
---|--- | ---|---
label | string | identifier | form field label
hint | string | nil | form field hint
placeholder | string | nil | form field placeholder
position | integer | auto-increment | position of the field within the part (only for the admin area)
required | boolean | true | must this field have a value for the form to save
type | string | `string` | choose between: `boolean`, `date`, `decimal`, `file`, `image`, `integer`, `rich_text`, `text`, `string`, `resource_link` (needs value: resource_linked), `external_link` (needs value: http://site.com)
default | string | nil | set the value but don't overwrite (only set if nil)
value | string | nil | USE ONLY FOR types `resource_link` and `external_link` (this will overwrite user input, in most cases use the `default` key instead)


## Create Resources
To add an admin area for a model simply type (make sure the model exists first and migrations have been run)

```sh
rails g cardboard:resource model_name
```

Then customize the `controllers/cardboard/model_name_controller.rb` and associated views to your heart's desire.


The default cardboard resource scaffold help you quickly get started by making the most of the following gems. 

Gem | Description 
--- | --- 
[InheritedResources](https://github.com/josevalim/inherited_resources) | Inherited Resources speeds up development by making your controllers inherit all restful actions so you just have to focus on what is important.
[Simple Form](https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form) | Forms made easy! It's tied to a simple DSL, with no opinion on markup.
[Kaminari](https://github.com/amatsuda/kaminari) | A Scope & Engine based, clean, powerful, customizable and sophisticated paginator
[Ransack](https://github.com/ernie/ransack) | Object-based searching and filtering
[Dragonfly](https://github.com/markevans/dragonfly) | On-the-fly image processing and file uploading


### Menu options
```ruby
  menu  label: "Test", priority: 1
```
You can also choose to remove a resource from the menu
```ruby
  menu  false
```

### Sorting
```ruby
  default_order "name DESC" # default: 'updated_at desc'
```
You can pass any `ransack` sort order, which includes associations. Example: 
```ruby
  default_order "user_name" # belongs to a user
```

#### Filter helper
You can show filters on your resource index page simply by adding `cardboard_filters`, with the model class, the main field to search (has to be a text or string field), and options.

```ruby
= cardboard_filters User, :name
```

`title`: change the page's title (optional)

`new_button:` Options for the new button which is enabled by default.  Allowed keys are `enabled` (true or false) and `label` (string).
`new_btn`: edit the new resource button's text (optional)

Example:
```ruby
= cardboard_filters User, :name, title: "Employees", new_btn: "Add an employee"
```

#### Pagination Helper
We use kaminari, so all you need to do is add to your index view:
```ruby
= paginate @users
```


#### Column sorting helper
Cardboard's controllers inherit from a `@q` variable which gives access to the ransack gem. 
```
= sort_link @q, :name, "Product Name" 
```

#### Custom resource helpers
To add custom helpers for your resource simply create a helper with the same name. 
Example:
```ruby
module Cardboard
  module PianosHelper
  end
end
```
Make sure this file is located under `app/helpers/cardboard`

#### Custom CSS/JS
The css/js for the resources is the same as the cardboard admin interface. If you'd like to extend or overwrite some of these, simply edit the `cardboard.css.scss` or `cardboard.js` files located in your assets folder. These files were generated during the cardboard installation.

Note: Make sure to remove `*= require_tree .` from your application.css, you don't want your cardboard css and js to leak into your main app!

## Create Settings
You can create new settings that will be editable from the admin panel. 

In your `config/cardboard.yml`

```yml
settings:
  my_custom_setting:
    type: boolean
    default: true
```
all options/types from fields are available

Then you can use this setting in your views or controllers like so:

```ruby
Cardboard::Setting.my_custom_setting
```

## View Helpers
### Access Pages
```ruby
current_page
```

you can put your controller instance variables at the top of your view or in a decorator
```
app
|- decorators
  |- controllers
    |- pages_decorator
```
```ruby
PagesController.class_eval do
  def page_identifier
    @example = "cool"
  end
end
``` 

### Meta tags (SEO)
To add SEO meta tags simply add a yield as follows to your layout file:
```slim
head
 = yield(:seo)
```
### Show edit link
Feel free to make it fit as you want in your site design
```slim
- if current_admin_user && current_page
  div style="float:right"
    = link_to "Edit this page", cardboard.edit_page_path(current_page)
```
### Page navigation
```slim
= nested_pages do |page, subpages|
  .indent
    = link_to(page.title, page.url) if page.in_menu?
    = subpages
```
or similarly with UL and LI tags

```slim
ul
  = nested_pages do |page, subpages|
    li
      = link_to(page.title, page.url) if page.in_menu?
      - if subpages
        ul= subpages
```

### Link to a page
Use the page identifier defined in the cardboard.yml file (or see yoda)
```ruby
  = link_to_page "page_identifier", class: "btn" do |page|
    "hello #{page.title}"
  end
  
  # or, to simply use the page title

  = link_to_page "page_identifier", class: "btn"
```

## Abilities
You can (and should) add a `can_manage_cardboard` method to your user model. By default users can manage all areas of the admin panel.
```ruby
def can_manage_cardboard?(area)
  case area
  when :pages
    self.admin?
  when :settings
    self.admin?
  when :resource_identifier #should be plural
    true
  else
    true
  end
end
```

## Dashboard
You can add whatever you want on the dashboard by simply adding
```
views
|- cardboard
   |- dashboard
       |- index.html.slim
```

## Customizing Cardboard

### Overwrite views
You can easily change the default behavior of the app by overwriting the views. For example say you'd like to change the my account page. Simply add a `views/cardboard/my_account/edit.html.slim` and edit it at will.
